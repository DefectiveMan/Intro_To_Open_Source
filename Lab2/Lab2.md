##Why it is important to choose a license
It is important to choose a license when creating Open Source software, becuase with a license you are guaranteed freedoms throught the license.  Without having a license, the software is not Open Source, because they are not contractually obligated to follow the standards set by the license.

##Not Using a Project with a License
When choosing a project to work on or use, if it is marketed as Open Source it is necessary to make sure it has a license.  This is because without a license the software is not truly free.  Free meaning that you are guaranteed the rights to modify and distribute as you see fit.
